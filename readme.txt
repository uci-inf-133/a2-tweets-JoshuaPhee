1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 3/3 Summarizing tweets
- 4/4 Identifying the most popular activities
- 3/3 Adding a text earch interface

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
Between 20-23 hours.


3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)
The linked https://developer.mozilla.org/ on the class website for LocaleDateString() doc. I used the same website for querySelectorAll 
doc. I used the online editor provided in the A2 page: https://vega.github.io/editor/#/examples/vega-lite/bar. I also googled if there
was a way to sort the encoding and the google ai explained the sort and color. Google ai also taught me that I can create a small kind
of function in a line and I used that to make the href for the links. I had an issue with using quotes outside so I asked what could be
wrong and it told me that I should use back quotes like `` instead. I also noticed that I didn't need to use the given get writtenText in
tweet.ts because I could just loop through the parsed data using written() function instead to see if it is or not. 

I also didn't hard code the data but instead went through the parsed data to find all missing "???".


4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I originally asked in slack a question about how I can get the array/parsed data into the event handler and I figured out that I could
stack the .then() and so I used that to pass the parsed data straight into it. I took the question down afterwards.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
